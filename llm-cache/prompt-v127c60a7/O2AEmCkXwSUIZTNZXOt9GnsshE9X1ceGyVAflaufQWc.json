      {
        "name": "viem",
        "motivation": "The code contains the version string `viem@2.23.5` and references to its documentation URL `https://viem.sh`. It heavily uses functions characteristic of the `viem` library, such as `readContract`, `estimateGas`, `getEnsAddress`, `createPublicClient`, and defines numerous custom error classes that extend `viem`'s `BaseError` (e.g., `ContractFunctionExecutionError`)."
      },
      {
        "name": "Plausible Tracker",
        "motivation": "The code includes a factory function `plausible(e)` that sets up analytics tracking. It contains strings like `[Plausible] Ignoring event because website is running locally` and makes `XMLHttpRequest` POST requests to an API endpoint at `/api/event` on a configurable host, which defaults to `https://plausible.io`."
      },
      {
        "name": "multiformats / ipld",
        "motivation": "The code contains extensive logic for handling various multibase encodings such as `base32`, `base36`, `base58btc`, and `base64`. It also references concepts from the IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data) ecosystem, including CIDs (Content Identifiers), `dag-pb`, and `dag-cbor`, which are core components of the `multiformats` and `ipld` libraries."
      },
      {
        "name": "debug",
        "motivation": "The code includes a factory function for creating namespaced debug loggers, with methods like `enable`, `disable`, `selectColor`, and `humanize`. This pattern is characteristic of the `debug` library for Node.js and browsers."
      },
      {
        "name": "EventEmitter",
        "motivation": "The code defines a constructor function `a` with prototype methods such as `on`, `once`, `emit`, `removeListener`, and `removeAllListeners`. This is a classic implementation of the EventEmitter pattern, commonly found in libraries like `eventemitter3` or Node.js's native events module."

        "type": "auxiliary",
        "motivation": "The Plausible analytics tracker code explicitly creates an `XMLHttpRequest` instance to send analytics events. The URL is constructed as `${t.apiHost}/api/event`, where `apiHost` is configured with a default value of `\"https://plausible.io\"`."

        "motivation": "The `viem` library's HTTP transport uses `fetch` to send JSON-RPC requests. The code defines a default chain configuration for Ethereum Mainnet which includes `rpcUrls:{default:{http:[\"https://eth.merkle.io\"]}}`. Numerous functions in the codebase are wrappers around `e.request({method: \"eth_...\"})` which are ultimately fulfilled by this transport."

        "library": "viem",
        "type": "auxiliary",
        "motivation": "Within the ENS avatar resolution logic (`getEnsAvatar`), `viem` uses `fetch` to retrieve metadata and image files. The code constructs gateway URLs for decentralized storage protocols, using `https://ipfs.io` as the default for IPFS and `https://arweave.net` for Arweave. These calls are made with a `HEAD` method to check content-type or a `GET` method to retrieve JSON metadata."
