      {
        "name": "viem",
        "motivation": "The code creates an Ethereum client using a structure highly indicative of `viem`. It uses functions like `createPublicClient` (minified as `(0,x.l)`) and defines transports like `http` (`(0,b.L)`) and `custom` (`(0,f.I)`). It also makes contract calls using an ABI with `readContract`, for example to resolve ENS content hashes."
      },
      {
        "name": "ipfs-unixfs / @ipld/car",
        "motivation": "The application interacts with IPFS data structures. It uses functions like `fs.cat()` and `fs.ls()` to read files and list directories from a CAR (Content Addressable aRchive) file. The code explicitly parses a CAR file fetched from the server using a CAR reader (`(s=new X.v).fromBytes(a,{verify:!0})`) and interacts with its blockstore, which is characteristic of libraries from the IPFS/IPLD ecosystem."
      },
      {
        "name": "multiformats",
        "motivation": "The code decodes and encodes CIDs (Content Identifiers). The function `F(n)` processes a content hash, attempting to decode it from various formats, and uses a call like `E.TO.decode(r).toV1().toString(z.base32)`, which is a clear sign of the `multiformats` library being used to handle CID objects and their different bases (like base32)."
      },
      {
        "name": "remark",
        "motivation": "The code contains a function `bn(n)` that processes markdown strings into HTML. It uses a chain of `.use()` calls and a `processSync()` method (`(0,cn.l)().use(pn.A).use(gn.A).processSync(n)`), which is the standard API for the `unified` ecosystem, of which `remark` is the markdown processor."
      },
      {
        "name": "plausible-tracker",
        "motivation": "The code initializes an analytics tracker with the domain `dapprank.eth.link` and enables automatic pageviews: `(0,(0,Mn.A)({domain:\"dapprank.eth.link\",trackLocalhost:!0}).enableAutoPageviews)()`. This matches the API and usage pattern of the `plausible-tracker` library."

        "type": "rpc",
        "motivation": "The code hardcodes this URL (`o=\"https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co/...\") as a fallback Ethereum RPC endpoint when creating the `viem` client. This client is then used for on-chain data lookups, such as resolving ENS names."

        "motivation": "The code makes multiple `fetch` calls to relative paths to load application data. For example, it constructs a URL `o=\"\".concat(n,\"?format=car\")` where `n` is a path like `/dapps/archive/{dapp_name}/` to retrieve a CAR file containing the dapp's data. Other calls fetch JSON metadata and reports from similar relative paths."

The extracted URL is then used to configure an RPC transport for the `viem` client.\n\n```javascript\nn=function(n){\n  // ...\n  var e=new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)\n  ,r=\"ds-rpc-\".concat(n)\n  ,t=e.get(r);\n  return t?(console.log(\"Using RPC URL from query parameters for chain \".concat(n,\": \").concat(t)),t):null\n}(1)\n```"

The code contains a generic fallback detection function (`In(n,e)`) that is called with `\"bundler\"`. This indicates that the application is designed to detect and potentially use bundler endpoints specified via `?ds-bundler-<CHAIN_ID>=url` as described in the rendered DappSpec information."
