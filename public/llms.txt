# DappRank: Measuring Censorship Resistance in Web3 Applications

DappRank is a dashboard which evaluates and ranks decentralized applications (dApps) based on their resistance to censorship. It analyzes the technical implementation of each application to determine how well it would continue to function in environments where centralized services might be blocked or compromised.

# Censorship Resistance Scoring Algorithm

## Overview
The censorship resistance score evaluates how resistant a web application is to censorship by measuring its reliance on external dependencies and its use of decentralized web3 technologies. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better censorship resistance.

## Baseline
- All applications start with a baseline score of 70 points

## Scoring Factors

### Web3 Interactions (Positive Factor)
Web3 interactions with decentralized services improve the score, but ONLY if the application has no external dependencies:
- Each web3 interaction adds 5 points
- Maximum bonus from web3 interactions: +30 points
- This bonus is only applied if there are NO distribution or networking issues

### Distribution Purity Issues (Negative Factor)
External resources that could be censored reduce the score:
- Each external script: -5 points (max -25)
- Each external media resource: -1 points (max -5)
- Maximum penalty from distribution issues: -30 points

### Networking Purity Issues (Negative Factor)
External network connections that could be blocked reduce the score:
- Each HTTP request: -3 points (max -20)
- Each WebSocket connection: -2 points (max -15)
- Each WebRTC connection: -1 point (max -5)
- Maximum penalty from networking issues: -40 points

## Score Categories
- High (70-100): Excellent censorship resistance
- Medium (40-69): Moderate censorship resistance
- Low (0-39): Poor censorship resistance

## Implementation Details
1. The algorithm first checks if the application has any distribution or networking issues
2. If there are NO issues, it adds points for web3 interactions (up to +30)
3. It then subtracts points for any distribution issues (up to -40)
4. It also subtracts points for any networking issues (up to -30)
5. The final score is capped between 0 and 100

## Example Calculation
For an application with:
- 8 web3 interactions
- 3 external scripts
- 2 external media resources
- 4 HTTP requests
- 1 WebSocket connection

The calculation would be:
- Start with baseline: 70 points
- Has distribution and networking issues, so NO bonus for web3 interactions
- Distribution penalty: (3 × -3) + (2 × -2) = -13 points
- Networking penalty: (4 × -3) + (1 × -2) = -14 points
- Final score: 70 - 13 - 14 = 43 points (Medium category)

## Rationale
This scoring system rewards applications that are fully self-contained and use decentralized technologies, while penalizing those that depend on centralized services that could be points of censorship. A truly censorship-resistant application should have no external dependencies that could be blocked or manipulated.
